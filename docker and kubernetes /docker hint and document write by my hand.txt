you can find the documintation in docker hub in the same container you download it

in docker we need creat 2 file docker type first one is 
docker-compose.yaml
second ****
Dockerfile
inside the docker file we write the container code what ever it is 


in yaml we need to specify the file and using docker-compose and the default file where the code upload on server 


in docker and k8s
we need to know about pods then worknodes then control pods then cluster after that 
when we need to push any image and deployment to k8s we need to push the image to our repo in docker to identify the image by using command existing in command file docker
